Small Applications of Hibernate -ORM like  crud operations etc

Hibernate - ORM is an open source ORM framework developed by Gavin King and it is worked upon by JBoss Community , which is consistently 
working upon it to improve its functionality.


 Hibernate-ORM is layering to JDBC (Java Database connectivity), we don't have to write manual queries there are POJO(Plain Old Java Objects)
 having setter or getters to insert or fetch the value from the database.
